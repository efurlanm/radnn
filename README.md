# RADNN

This repository contains my personal research notes on the application of physics-based machine learning (PIML) to scientific problems. The '[src](src)' directory contains the main files related to the research, as well as the documentation sources. As this research is ongoing, expect the repository and the documentation to remain a work in progress (WIP) and subject to change.

# RADNN

*Last edited: 2024-10-23*

Resolution of Partial Differential Equations by Physically Informed Neural Networks Applied to the Radiation Module of a Numerical Weather Forecast Model.

This repository contains my personal notes on research, and experiments related to radiation scheme for use in weather and climate models. The work is based on Ukkonen & Hogan (2023) [[4]](#ref04) and several other authors. One of the researches is to understand the replacement of the [RRTMGP](https://github.com/earth-system-radiation/rte-rrtmgp) lookup table by a model using PIML.

This repository is a work in progress and is subject to constant change.

## Notebooks

(unsorted list)

- [ukk23test01-train-v2.ipynb](ukk23test01-train-v2.ipynb) : continuation of `ukk23test01-train-v1.ipynb`, adding more documentation, better organization, complete training, etc.

- [ukk23test01-train-v1.ipynb](ukk23test01-train-v1.ipynb) : generates files containing the neural network (NN) model that is later used in the RTE+RRTMGP-NN model. The implementation uses TensorFlow/Python for training the NN, and Fortran routines are used to generate the training dataset. Based on [[1]](#ref01).

- [ukk23test01-rfmip-clear-sky.ipynb](ukk23test01-rfmip-clear-sky.ipynb) : runs the RFMIP-CLEAR-SKY example, described in [[1]](#ref01).

- [ecrad01-gprof.ipynb](ecrad01-gprof.ipynb) : gprof of ecrad executable from ecrad dir.

- [ukk23eo01-gprof.ipynb](ukk23eo01-gprof.ipynb) : gprof of ecrad executable from ukk23eo01 dir (optimized version of ecRad radiation scheme with new RRTMGP-NN gas optics).

- [ecrad-01-sd-v240823.ipynb](ecrad-01-sd-v240823.ipynb) : shows the original ecRad radiation module using conventional numerical method, running on SDumont. {work in progress}

- [ukk23test01-train-sd-v240823.ipynb](ukk23test01-train-sd-v240823.ipynb) : DNN network training for the optical gas radiation problem, running on SDumont. {work in progress}

## Notes

1. From <https://github.com/peterukk/rte-rrtmgp-nn/tree/2.0> :
   
   1. Instead of the original lookup-table interpolation routine and "eta" parameter to handle the overlapping absorption of gases in a given band, this fork implements neural networks (NNs) to predict optical properties for given atmospheric conditions and gas concentrations, which includes all minor longwave (LW) gases supported by RRTMGP. The NNs predict molecular absorption (LW/SW), scattering (SW) or emission (LW) for all spectral points from an input vector consisting of temperature, pressure and gas concentrations of an atmospheric layer. The models have been trained on 6-7 million samples (LW) spanning a wide range of conditions (pre-industrial, present-day, future...) so that they may be used for both weather and climate applications.

2. From <https://zenodo.org/records/7413952> :
   
   1. The files contain datasets for training neural network versions of the RRTMGP gas optics scheme (as described in the paper) that are read by `ml_train.py`.
   
   2. The ML datasets were generated using the input profiles datasets and running the Fortran programs `rrtmgp_sw_gendata_rfmipstyle.F90` and `rrtmgp_lw_gendata_rfmipstyle.F90` in `rte-rrtmgp-nn/examples/rrtmgp-nn-training`, which call the RRTMGP gas optics scheme.

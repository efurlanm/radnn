This directory contains the 1D profile of the I3RC cumulus test case
used by Hogan et al. (2016). Typing "make test" in this directory runs
the various 1D and 3D configurations of ECRAD. The Matlab script
plot_i3rc.m can then be used to visualize the results, reproducing
three of the figures from Hogan et al. (2016). Note that you will need
to ensure that a reasonably up-to-date version of the "nco" tools are
available and in your path.  This test involves running the
duplicate_profiles.sh script, which duplicates the single profile in
i3rc_mls_cumulus.nc, each with a different solar zenith angle.

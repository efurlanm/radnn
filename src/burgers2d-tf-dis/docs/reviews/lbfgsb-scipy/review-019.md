## Review 019

### File Review

*   **`GEMINI.md`**: The objective is to discover the parameters of the 2D Burgers' equation using a PINN. The main issue is that the PINN model is producing incorrect results, where the predicted solution does not match the measured solution, even though the discovered viscosity parameter is close to the real value. The goal is to make the "Measured Solution" and "PINN Solution" graphs in the output figure, `pinn_results_03_scipy_test.jpg`, look similar. The file also mentions that the loss function was corrected by adding a weight to the data loss term, which resulted in a visually correct plot and a reasonably accurate discovered viscosity.
*   **`docs/reviews/lbfgsb-scipy/review-018.md`**: This review file indicates that the root cause of the numerical instability in the L-BFGS-B optimizer was gradient normalization. Removing it resulted in a successful identification of the kinematic viscosity parameter. The review concludes that no further actions are required for this specific problem.
*   **`main_scipy.py`**: This is the main script for the PINN model. It uses TensorFlow 1.x with a SciPy L-BFGS-B optimizer. The script generates "measured" data using a finite difference method and then trains the PINN to discover the viscosity parameter. The loss function is defined as `10 * loss_data + loss_pde`.
*   **`plot_results.py`**: This script is used to plot the results from the `.npz` file generated by `main_scipy.py`. It plots the "Measured Solution" and the "PINN Solution" side-by-side.

### Key Findings from the Code

*   The `main_scipy.py` script is using a combination of Adam and L-BFGS-B optimizers.
*   The loss function has a weight of 10 for the data loss, which was a correction made to address the issue of the PDE loss overpowering the data-fitting loss.
*   The script is using TensorFlow 1.x, which requires a different approach to gradient computation compared to TensorFlow 2.x.
*   The `review-018.md` file states that the problem was solved by removing gradient normalization.

### Internet Research

I will perform a web search to find information about common issues with PINN models and the L-BFGS-B optimizer.

### Proposed Next Steps Based on Review and Research

1.  **Run the current script:** I will first run the `main_scipy.py` script as-is to see the current output and verify the results described in the `GEMINI.md` and `review-018.md` files.
2.  **Analyze the output:** I will analyze the output of the script, including the generated plot and the discovered viscosity value.
3.  **Propose further improvements:** Based on the analysis, I will propose further improvements to the model or the training process if needed.

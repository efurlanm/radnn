## Review 020

### Analysis of the Results

I have run the `main_scipy.py` script and analyzed the output. Here are my findings:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.0246`, which is not very close to the true value of `0.05`.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is visually similar to the measured solution, which is a good sign. However, the discrepancy in the discovered viscosity indicates that the model is not fully accurate.
*   **Optimizer Performance:** The L-BFGS-B optimizer converges, but it seems to be getting stuck in a local minimum, preventing it from finding the true viscosity value.

### Internet Research

I will perform a web search for techniques to improve the accuracy of PINN models, specifically focusing on parameter discovery problems.

### Proposed Next Steps

1.  **Increase the weight of the PDE loss:** The current loss function is `10 * loss_data + loss_pde`. I will try increasing the weight of the PDE loss to see if it helps the optimizer to better satisfy the underlying physics of the problem.
2.  **Adjust the number of PDE points:** The current number of PDE points is 80,000. I will experiment with increasing this number to see if a more accurate approximation of the PDE residual helps the optimizer.
3.  **Experiment with the neural network architecture:** I will try different neural network architectures, such as increasing the number of layers or neurons, to see if it improves the model's ability to approximate the solution.
4.  **Run multiple experiments:** I will run multiple experiments with different random seeds to ensure that the results are consistent and not due to a lucky initialization.

I will start by increasing the weight of the PDE loss.

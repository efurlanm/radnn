## Review 031

### Analysis of the Results

After increasing the weight of the PDE loss to 50, I observed the following:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.059543`, which is very close to the true value of `0.05`. This is a significant improvement in parameter discovery.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is no longer visually similar to the measured solution. The shape is significantly different, indicating that the model has sacrificed data fitting to satisfy the PDE more accurately.

This highlights the trade-off between accurate parameter discovery and visually accurate solution representation. Increasing the PDE loss weight improved the `nu` estimation but degraded the solution's shape.

### Proposed Next Steps

To find a better balance, I will reduce the weight of the PDE loss to an intermediate value. I will try `20` to see if it allows the model to maintain a good visual fit while still improving the `nu` discovery. I will then run the experiment and analyze the results.

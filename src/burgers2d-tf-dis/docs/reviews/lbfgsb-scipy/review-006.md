# Review 006: Further Investigation of L-BFGS-B Convergence

## Precise and Detailed Analysis

This review continues the investigation into the non-convergence of the L-BFGS-B optimizer in `burgers2d-03.py`.

As observed in `review-005.md`, even after addressing TensorFlow `GradientTape` warnings and relaxing the L-BFGS-B `tolerance` to `1e-7`, the optimizer still did not converge. The optimizer stopped before reaching the `max_iterations` limit, suggesting that the `tolerance` might still be too strict for the current optimization landscape, or the optimization landscape itself is challenging.

## Next Steps

1.  **Re-evaluate L-BFGS-B `tolerance` and `max_iterations`:**
    -   Given that the optimizer is not hitting the `max_iterations` limit, the `tolerance` might still be too strict for the problem's inherent precision.
    -   Consider increasing `max_iterations` to a much larger value (e.g., 100000 or 200000) to definitively check if it eventually converges with the current `tolerance`. This will help determine if it's a matter of more iterations being needed or if the optimizer is truly stuck.
    -   Alternatively, try a slightly less strict `tolerance` (e.g., `1e-6` or `1e-5`) in conjunction with a high `max_iterations` to see if it converges faster.

2.  **Examine the Loss Function Behavior:**
    -   If L-BFGS-B continues to not converge, it might be beneficial to plot the loss function's behavior during the L-BFGS-B phase (if possible, by adding logging within the `lbfgs_loss_and_grads` function) to understand if it's plateauing, oscillating, or encountering other issues.

3.  **Review PINN Architecture and Data:**
    -   Consider if the neural network architecture (number of layers, neurons) is sufficient for the complexity of the Burgers 2D equation.
    -   Verify the quality and distribution of the training data (data points and PDE points). Insufficient or poorly distributed data can hinder convergence.

4.  **Research L-BFGS-B in PINNs:**
    -   Perform a targeted internet search for common issues and best practices when using L-BFGS-B with PINNs, especially for Burgers' equation, to identify potential pitfalls or alternative strategies.

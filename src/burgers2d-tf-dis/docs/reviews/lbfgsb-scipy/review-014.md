# Review 014: Persistent L-BFGS-B Non-Convergence with Relaxed Tolerance and Increased Network Complexity

## Precise and Detailed Analysis

The `burgers2d-03.py` script was executed again after relaxing the L-BFGS-B `tolerance` to `1e-2`. The execution completed without any `stderr` warnings.

Analysis of the updated `log.txt` reveals the following:

-   **Adam Optimizer Phase:**
    -   The initial `nu_pinn` guess was `0.100000`.
    -   Adam training ran for 1900 epochs.
    -   The loss decreased from `191.895615` to `0.075864`.
    -   The discovered `nu` value after Adam training was `0.099110`.

-   **L-BFGS-B Optimizer Phase:**
    -   L-BFGS-B training finished.
    -   **Convergence:** `L-BFGS-B converged: False`. Even with a very relaxed `tolerance` of `1e-2`, the optimizer still did not converge.
    -   **Number of Iterations:** `L-BFGS-B number of iterations: 6`. This is still extremely low, indicating that the optimizer stopped almost immediately.
    -   **Function Evaluations:** `L-BFGS-B function evaluations: 47`.
    -   **Final Discovered `nu`:** `0.099107`. This value is still very close to the `nu` value after Adam training, suggesting that L-BFGS-B performed minimal effective updates.

The persistent non-convergence of L-BFGS-B, even with a very relaxed tolerance, and its immediate stopping, strongly suggests that the optimization landscape for the larger network (40 neurons, 40000 PDE points) is extremely challenging for L-BFGS-B to navigate from the Adam-trained state. The `nu` value is consistently stuck around the initial guess and Adam's output, indicating a potential issue with the sensitivity of the loss function to `nu` or a very flat region in the optimization landscape around the current `nu` value.

## Next Steps

1.  **Explore alternative `nu` initialization:** Since `nu` is consistently stuck around 0.1, it might be beneficial to try initializing `log_nu_pinn` closer to the true value (0.05) for testing purposes. This would help diagnose if the issue is with the optimization landscape around 0.1 or a more general problem with `nu` identification.

2.  **Consider `max_iterations`:** Although it's not hitting `max_iterations`, setting it to a very high value (e.g., `500000`) ensures that if the tolerance is eventually met, it has enough iterations.

3.  **Document Findings in `review-014.md`:** Create a new review file to document these observations and the plan for further investigation.

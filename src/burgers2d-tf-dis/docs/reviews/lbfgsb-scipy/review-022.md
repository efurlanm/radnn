## Review 022

### Analysis of the Results

I have run the `main_scipy.py` script with the PDE loss weight set to 50. Here are my findings:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.0604`, which is close to the true value of `0.05`.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is still not a good match for the measured solution.
*   **Optimizer Performance:** The L-BFGS-B optimizer is converging, but the solution is not accurate.

### Proposed Next Steps

I will go back to the original loss function (`10 * loss_data + loss_pde`) and increase the number of PDE points from 80,000 to 160,000. This will provide a more accurate approximation of the PDE residual and may help the optimizer to find a better solution.

## Review 023

### Analysis of the Results

I attempted to run the `main_scipy.py` script with the number of PDE points increased to 160,000. However, the script failed with a `ResourceExhaustedError`, which means the GPU ran out of memory.

### Proposed Next Steps

I will revert the number of PDE points back to 80,000 and try a different approach to improve the model's accuracy. I will now focus on experimenting with the neural network architecture. I will start by increasing the number of neurons in each hidden layer from 40 to 60.

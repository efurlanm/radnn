# Review 004: Implementation of TFP L-BFGS-B and Verification Plan

## Precise and Detailed Analysis

### Changes Made to `burgers2d-03.py`

Based on the analysis in `review-003.md`, the following modifications have been applied to `burgers2d-03.py`:

1.  **Import `tensorflow_probability`:** Added `import tensorflow_probability as tfp` to enable the use of TFP's L-BFGS-B optimizer.
2.  **Replaced `scipy.optimize.minimize` with `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize`:** The `train` method was updated to use `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize` for the L-BFGS-B optimization phase. This involved:
    -   Defining an `@tf.function` `lbfgs_loss_and_grads` that returns the loss and gradients, compatible with `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize`'s `value_and_gradients_function` argument.
    -   Passing `self.trainable_variables` directly as `initial_position` to `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize`.
    -   Setting `max_iterations` to 50000 and `tolerance` to `1.0 * np.finfo(float).eps` to match the previous `ftol`.
    -   Updating the trainable variables with the optimized values from `lbfgs_results.position`.
3.  **Removed Obsolete Methods:** The `get_weights_1d`, `set_weights`, and `flatten_grads` methods were removed as they are no longer necessary when using `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize`, which operates directly on TensorFlow tensors.

These changes aim to leverage TensorFlow's native capabilities for L-BFGS-B optimization, potentially leading to better integration, stability, and convergence precision.

## Next Steps

1.  **Run the Modified Code:** Execute `burgers2d-03.py` to observe the behavior of the new L-BFGS-B implementation. Redirect the output to `log.txt` as specified in the instructions.
    -   Command: `source $HOME/conda/bin/activate tf2 && python /home/x/inpe/burgers2dtfdis-working/burgers2d-03.py > log.txt`
2.  **Analyze `log.txt`:** Examine the `log.txt` file for information regarding the L-BFGS-B convergence, including:
    -   Whether it converged (`lbfgs_results.converged`).
    -   The number of iterations (`lbfgs_results.num_iterations`).
    -   The number of function evaluations (`lbfgs_results.num_objective_evaluations`).
    -   The final discovered `nu` value.
    -   Any error messages or warnings.
3.  **Document Verification Results:** Record the findings from the `log.txt` analysis in `review-005.md`.
4.  **Update Paper (`burgers2d-03.md`):** Based on the verification results, update the paper to reflect the new L-BFGS-B implementation and its impact on convergence precision. This will be done in a later step after successful verification.

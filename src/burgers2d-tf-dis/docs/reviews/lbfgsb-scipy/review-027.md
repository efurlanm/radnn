### Analysis of the Results

I have tried several approaches to improve the accuracy of the discovered viscosity, including:

*   Increasing the weight of the PDE loss
*   Increasing the number of PDE points
*   Increasing the number of neurons in each hidden layer
*   Increasing the number of hidden layers
*   Increasing the number of Adam epochs

None of these approaches have been completely successful. While some of them have resulted in a visually correct solution, the discovered viscosity is still not accurate. This suggests that the issue may not be with the model itself, but with the data or the problem setup.

### Proposed Next Steps

I will now focus on analyzing the data and the problem setup to see if there are any issues that may be preventing the model from accurately identifying the viscosity parameter. I will start by:

1.  **Analyzing the generated data:** I will analyze the generated data to see if there are any issues that may be affecting the model's performance. For example, I will check if the data is too noisy or if it does not contain enough information to accurately identify the viscosity parameter.
2.  **Analyzing the problem setup:** I will analyze the problem setup to see if there are any issues that may be affecting the model's performance. For example, I will check if the domain is large enough or if the initial and boundary conditions are well-posed.

# Review 002: Key Takeaways from burgers2d-03.md and burgers2d-03.py

## Key Takeaways from `burgers2d-03.md` (The Paper)

- **Problem Definition:** The paper focuses on the 2D Burgers equation with viscosity, defining the `u` and `v` components and their partial derivatives.
- **Methodology:** It implicitly uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the Burgers 2D equations.
- **Optimization:** The paper mentions the objective of comparing the current L-BFGS-B optimization with `l-bfgs-b-tf1.md` to find a solution for convergence precision. This indicates that L-BFGS-B is a critical component of the training process and its convergence behavior is a concern.
- **References:** `raissi2019` and `cuomo2022` are mentioned as base and reference papers, suggesting that the methodology is likely derived from these works.
- **Goal:** The overarching goal is to make the paper more innovative and relevant, specifically by addressing the L-BFGS-B convergence.

## Key Takeaways from `burgers2d-03.py` (The Code)

- **PINN Implementation:** The code implements a PINN for the 2D Burgers equation.
- **Neural Network Architecture:**
    - Input layer: 3 neurons (x, y, t).
    - Hidden layers: 4 layers with 20 neurons each.
    - Output layer: 2 neurons (u, v).
    - Activation function: `tanh` for hidden layers.
    - Weight initialization: Xavier initializer.
- **Loss Function:** The loss function combines two components:
    - **Data Loss:** Mean squared error between predicted `u`, `v` and "measured" `u_data`, `v_data`.
    - **PDE Loss:** Mean squared error of the PDE residuals (`f_u` and `f_v`).
- **Optimization Process:**
    - **Two-stage training:**
        1.  **Adam Optimizer:** Used for an initial phase (`epochs_adam=40000`) with a learning rate of 0.0001. This stage likely helps the network find a good initial parameter space.
        2.  **L-BFGS-B Optimizer:** After Adam, `scipy.optimize.minimize` with `method='L-BFGS-B'` is used.
            -   `loss_and_grads` function: This function is passed to `minimize` and returns both the loss and the flattened gradients, as required by `scipy.optimize.minimize` when `jac=True`.
            -   `trainable_variables`: All weights, biases, and the `log_nu_pinn` are treated as trainable variables.
            -   `options`:
                -   `maxiter`: 50000
                -   `maxfun`: 50000
                -   `maxcor`: 50
                -   `maxls`: 50
                -   `ftol`: `1.0 * np.finfo(float).eps` (machine epsilon for float). This is a very strict tolerance for the function value, which could be related to convergence issues if not met.
- **Discoverable Parameter:** The kinematic viscosity `nu` is treated as a discoverable parameter, represented as `tf.exp(self.log_nu_pinn)`.
- **Data Generation:**
    - "Measured" data (`u_medido`, `v_medido`) is generated by a forward simulation of the Burgers equation using a finite difference method.
    - PDE collocation points are randomly sampled within the domain.
- **Results Saving:** The trained model's predictions and the discovered `nu` are saved to `pinn_results_03.npz`.

## Next Steps

1.  Read the content of `l-bfgs-b-tf1.md` to understand the L-BFGS-B optimization described there, specifically looking for details on convergence precision.
2.  Compare the L-BFGS-B implementation in `burgers2d-03.py` with the description in `l-bfgs-b-tf1.md`.
3.  Document this comparison and any identified discrepancies or potential improvements in `review-003.md`.

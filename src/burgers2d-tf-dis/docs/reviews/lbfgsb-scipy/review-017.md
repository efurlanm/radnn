### Precise and Detailed Analysis

**Experiment:**

*   Increased the `maxcor` parameter in `scipy.optimize.minimize` from 50 to 100 in `burgers2d-03-scipy-test.py`.

**Observations:**

*   **L-BFGS-B Performance:** The change did not lead to an improvement. The optimizer converged even faster than before, stopping after only 3 iterations.
*   **Numerical Instability:** The optimization process remains highly unstable. The log shows a massive jump in the loss function (from `6.8e-02` to `2.3e+03`) in the second L-BFGS-B iteration. This behavior is indicative of a poor search direction or step size, causing the optimizer to land in a region of extremely high loss.
*   **`nu` Accuracy:** The final discovered `nu` was `0.060481`, which is no closer to the true value of `0.05` than in previous attempts. The premature convergence prevents any meaningful refinement of the `nu` parameter.
*   **Convergence Message:** The optimizer terminated with the message `CONVERGENCE: REL_REDUCTION_OF_F_<=_FACTR*EPSMCH`, which means it stopped because the relative change in the loss function was extremely small. This, combined with the instability, suggests the optimizer is failing to find a productive search direction and gives up.

**Conclusion:**

Increasing `maxcor` was ineffective. The core problem appears to be the numerical instability within the L-BFGS-B optimization phase itself. The gradient normalization, which was implemented to help stabilize the process, might be having the opposite effect by causing drastic changes in the search direction.

### Next Steps

1.  **Remove Gradient Normalization:**
    *   The next logical step is to remove the gradient normalization from the `_loss_and_grads_scipy` function in `burgers2d-03-scipy-test.py`.
    *   This will allow the L-BFGS-B optimizer to use the raw gradient information. While this might lead to large gradient magnitudes, it will provide a more direct and potentially more stable optimization path without the artifacts introduced by normalization.
    *   We will then run the script and analyze the `log_scipy_test.txt` to see if this change leads to a more stable and effective L-BFGS-B optimization, allowing it to run for more iterations and converge closer to the true `nu` value.

2.  **Re-evaluate L-BFGS-B Parameters (if necessary):**
    *   If removing gradient normalization improves stability but convergence is still not ideal, we will revisit other L-BFGS-B parameters, such as `ftol` or `maxls` (maximum number of line search steps), to fine-tune the optimizer's behavior with the un-normalized gradients.

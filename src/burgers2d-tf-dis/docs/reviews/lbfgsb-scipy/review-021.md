## Review 021

### Analysis of the Results

I have run the `main_scipy.py` script with the PDE loss weight increased to 100. Here are my findings:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.060119`, which is very close to the true value of `0.05`.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is now significantly different from the measured solution. This is because the increased weight of the PDE loss has made the model prioritize satisfying the PDE, even at the expense of fitting the data.
*   **Optimizer Performance:** The L-BFGS-B optimizer is now able to find a better minimum, but the solution is not as accurate.

### Proposed Next Steps

I will try to find a better balance between the data fitting and PDE satisfaction. I will start by reducing the weight of the PDE loss to 50 and see if that improves the results.

# Review 007: Continued L-BFGS-B Non-Convergence and Tolerance Adjustment

## Precise and Detailed Analysis

The `burgers2d-03.py` script was executed again after increasing the `max_iterations` for L-BFGS-B to `100000`. The execution completed without any `stderr` warnings.

Analysis of the updated `log.txt` reveals the following:

-   **Adam Optimizer Phase:**
    -   The initial `nu_pinn` guess was `0.100000`.
    -   Adam training ran for 900 epochs.
    -   The loss decreased from `0.285504` to `0.064467`.
    -   The discovered `nu` value after Adam training was `0.098796`.

-   **L-BFGS-B Optimizer Phase:**
    -   L-BFGS-B training finished.
    -   **Convergence:** `L-BFGS-B converged: False`. Despite increasing `max_iterations` significantly, the optimizer still did not converge.
    -   **Number of Iterations:** `L-BFGS-B number of iterations: 11312`. This is higher than the previous runs but still far from the new `max_iterations` of `100000`. This further confirms that the optimizer is not hitting the iteration limit but is stopping due to some other internal criterion, likely the `tolerance`.
    -   **Function Evaluations:** `L-BFGS-B function evaluations: 33628`.
    -   **Final Discovered `nu`:** `0.020612`. This value is still significantly different from the `True nu: 0.05`.

The persistent non-convergence of L-BFGS-B, even with a very high `max_iterations`, strongly suggests that the `tolerance` of `1e-7` is still too strict for the current problem setup, or there's an issue with the optimization landscape that prevents it from reaching such a low tolerance.

## Next Steps

1.  **Relax L-BFGS-B `tolerance`:**
    -   The most immediate next step is to relax the `tolerance` to a less strict value, such as `1e-6` or `1e-5`. This will allow the optimizer to converge earlier if it's struggling to reach the current very tight tolerance.

2.  **Consider the Loss Function and Gradients:**
    -   If relaxing the tolerance doesn't lead to convergence, it might be necessary to delve deeper into the loss function and its gradients. Issues like very flat regions, local minima, or noisy gradients can prevent convergence.
    -   While not directly actionable with current tools, this is a mental note for further debugging if needed.

3.  **Review PINN Architecture and Data (Revisit):**
    -   Although previously considered, if the optimizer continues to struggle, a more thorough review of the neural network architecture and the distribution/density of training data points (both data and PDE points) might be necessary.

4.  **Document Findings in `review-007.md`:** Create a new review file to document these observations and the plan for further investigation.

### Analysis of the Results

After setting the PDE loss weight to 5, I observed the following:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.036200`, which is closer to the true value of `0.05` than previous attempts with higher PDE loss weights.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is now visually very similar to the measured solution. This is a significant improvement in visual accuracy and meets the primary objective of having similar graphs.

This indicates that we have achieved a good balance between visual accuracy and parameter discovery. The multi-time-step training strategy combined with a lower PDE loss weight has proven effective.

### Proposed Next Steps

To confirm the robustness and consistency of these results, I will:

1.  **Run Multiple Experiments with Different Random Seeds:** This will help verify if the model converges to similar results (both visually and for the `nu` value) under different random initializations. If the results are consistent, we can consider the primary objective achieved.

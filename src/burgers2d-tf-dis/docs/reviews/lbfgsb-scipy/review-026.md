## Review 026

### Analysis of the Results

My previous attempts to improve the model by increasing the network size and the number of training epochs resulted in `ResourceExhaustedError` (OOM) on the GPU. I made a mistake by not reverting the network architecture before increasing the epoch count, which caused the memory overload.

### Proposed Next Steps

I am reverting the model to its original configuration as described in the `GEMINI.md` file (`layers = [3, 40, 40, 40, 40, 2]` and `epochs_adam=2000`). 

My first execution of this baseline resulted in a discovered `nu` of `0.0246`, while the `GEMINI.md` file documents a `nu` of `0.009630`. I will re-run the baseline experiment to verify the result and determine if this discrepancy is due to the stochastic nature of the training (e.g., random weight initialization) or a more systematic problem. This will provide a stable and reproducible starting point for any further tuning.

### Analysis of the Results

I have successfully implemented the multi-time-step training strategy. Here are my findings:

*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is visually very similar to the measured solution, which is a great result. This indicates that the model is now able to learn the overall shape of the solution across multiple time steps.
*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.0243`, which is still not as close to the true value of `0.05` as I would like. However, the fact that the model can now correctly reproduce the shape of the solution across multiple time steps is a significant improvement.

### Proposed Final Plan

I will now focus on fine-tuning the model and the training process to get a more accurate result. I will try the following:

1.  **Increase the weight of the PDE loss:** Now that the model is able to learn the overall shape of the solution, I will try increasing the weight of the PDE loss again to see if it helps the optimizer to better satisfy the underlying physics of the problem.
2.  **Run multiple experiments:** I will run multiple experiments with different random seeds to ensure that the results are consistent and not due to a lucky initialization.

I will start by increasing the weight of the PDE loss to 50.

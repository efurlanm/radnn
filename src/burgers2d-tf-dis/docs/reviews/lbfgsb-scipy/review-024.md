## Review 024

### Analysis of the Results

I have run the `main_scipy.py` script with the number of neurons in each hidden layer increased to 60. Here are my findings:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.0105`, which is not as close to the true value of `0.05` as in some of the previous attempts.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is visually very similar to the measured solution, which is a good sign.
*   **Optimizer Performance:** The L-BFGS-B optimizer is converging, but it is still not finding a good minimum for the viscosity parameter.

### Proposed Next Steps

I will now try to increase the number of hidden layers from 4 to 6 to see if that improves the results. This will increase the model's capacity and may help it to better approximate the solution and identify the viscosity parameter.

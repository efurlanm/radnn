# Review 005: Analysis of L-BFGS-B Convergence and Next Steps

## Precise and Detailed Analysis

The `burgers2d-03.py` script was executed, and its output was redirected to `log.txt`. The execution completed without any critical errors, although several TensorFlow warnings regarding `GradientTape.gradient` were observed in `stderr`.

Analysis of `log.txt` reveals the following:

-   **Adam Optimizer Phase:**
    -   The initial `nu_pinn` guess was `0.100000`.
    -   Adam training ran for 900 epochs.
    -   The loss decreased from `0.089865` to `0.044124`.
    -   The discovered `nu` value after Adam training was `0.092703`.

-   **L-BFGS-B Optimizer Phase:**
    -   L-BFGS-B training finished.
    -   **Convergence:** `L-BFGS-B converged: False`. This is a critical finding, indicating that the optimizer did not reach the specified tolerance within the maximum number of iterations.
    -   **Number of Iterations:** `L-BFGS-B number of iterations: 9799`. This is close to the default `max_iterations` of 10000, suggesting it hit the iteration limit.
    -   **Function Evaluations:** `L-BFGS-B function evaluations: 29099`.
    -   **Final Discovered `nu`:** `0.016357`. This value is significantly different from the `True nu: 0.05`.

The fact that L-BFGS-B did not converge and the final discovered `nu` is far from the true value suggests that the current implementation or its parameters might need further tuning or investigation. The TensorFlow warnings about `GradientTape.gradient` might also be contributing to the non-convergence or inefficiency.

## Next Steps

1.  **Investigate L-BFGS-B Non-Convergence:**
    -   Review the `tfp.optimizer.lbfgs_minimize` parameters in `burgers2d-03.py`. Specifically, check `max_iterations` and `tolerance`. The current `tolerance` is `1.0 * np.finfo(float).eps`, which is a very small number and might be too strict, causing the optimizer to hit `max_iterations` before converging.
    -   Consider increasing `max_iterations` to see if the optimizer eventually converges with the current tolerance.
    -   Consider relaxing the `tolerance` to a more practical value (e.g., `1e-7` or `1e-8`) to see if it converges within the current `max_iterations`.
    -   Examine the loss function and gradients for any potential issues that might hinder convergence (e.g., vanishing/exploding gradients, non-smoothness).

2.  **Address TensorFlow Warnings:**
    -   Research the `WARNING:tensorflow:Calling GradientTape.gradient on a persistent tape inside its context is significantly less efficient...` message. This might involve restructuring the `lbfgs_loss_and_grads` function to avoid this inefficiency, which could improve performance and potentially aid convergence.

3.  **Document Findings in `review-005.md`:** Create a new review file to document these observations and the plan for further investigation.

4.  **Update `burgers2d-03.md`:** Once the L-BFGS-B convergence issue is resolved and a more accurate `nu` is discovered, update the paper to reflect the improved implementation and results. This will be done in a later step.

## Update after re-running with fixes (August 3, 2025)

## Precise and Detailed Analysis

The `burgers2d-03.py` script was executed again after modifying the `pde_residual` function to address TensorFlow `GradientTape` warnings and relaxing the L-BFGS-B `tolerance` to `1e-7`. The execution completed without any `stderr` warnings this time, which is a positive outcome.

Analysis of the updated `log.txt` reveals the following:

-   **Adam Optimizer Phase:**
    -   The initial `nu_pinn` guess was `0.100000`.
    -   Adam training ran for 900 epochs.
    -   The loss decreased from `0.181700` to `0.059387`.
    -   The discovered `nu` value after Adam training was `0.099527`.

-   **L-BFGS-B Optimizer Phase:**
    -   L-BFGS-B training finished.
    -   **Convergence:** `L-BFGS-B converged: False`. Despite the changes, the optimizer still did not converge.
    -   **Number of Iterations:** `L-BFGS-B number of iterations: 8676`. This is lower than the previous run (9799) but still indicates that it's not converging within the set `max_iterations` of 50000.
    -   **Function Evaluations:** `L-BFGS-B function evaluations: 25819`.
    -   **Final Discovered `nu`:** `0.017910`. This value is still significantly different from the `True nu: 0.05`.

The fact that L-BFGS-B still did not converge, even after addressing the `GradientTape` warnings and relaxing the tolerance, suggests that the issue might not be solely with the optimizer's parameters or the gradient computation efficiency. The optimizer is stopping before reaching the `max_iterations` limit, which implies it's hitting some other internal stopping criterion, likely related to the `tolerance` being too strict for the current optimization landscape, or the optimization landscape itself is challenging.

## Next Steps

1.  **Re-evaluate L-BFGS-B `tolerance` and `max_iterations`:**
    -   Given that the optimizer is not hitting the `max_iterations` limit, the `tolerance` might still be too strict for the problem's inherent precision.
    -   Consider increasing `max_iterations` to a much larger value (e.g., 100000 or 200000) to definitively check if it eventually converges with the current `tolerance`. This will help determine if it's a matter of more iterations being needed or if the optimizer is truly stuck.
    -   Alternatively, try a slightly less strict `tolerance` (e.g., `1e-6` or `1e-5`) in conjunction with a high `max_iterations` to see if it converges faster.

2.  **Examine the Loss Function Behavior:**
    -   If L-BFGS-B continues to not converge, it might be beneficial to plot the loss function's behavior during the L-BFGS-B phase (if possible, by adding logging within the `lbfgs_loss_and_grads` function) to understand if it's plateauing, oscillating, or encountering other issues.

3.  **Review PINN Architecture and Data:**
    -   Consider if the neural network architecture (number of layers, neurons) is sufficient for the complexity of the Burgers 2D equation.
    -   Verify the quality and distribution of the training data (data points and PDE points). Insufficient or poorly distributed data can hinder convergence.

4.  **Research L-BFGS-B in PINNs:**
    -   Perform a targeted internet search for common issues and best practices when using L-BFGS-B with PINNs, especially for Burgers' equation, to identify potential pitfalls or alternative strategies.

5.  **Document Findings in `review-006.md`:** Create a new review file to document these observations and the plan for further investigation.

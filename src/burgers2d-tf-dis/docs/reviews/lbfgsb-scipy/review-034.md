## Review 034: Consistency Check with Multiple Random Seeds

### Analysis of the Results

I have performed multiple runs with different random seeds (1 and 2) to assess the consistency of the model's performance. Here are the findings:

*   **Visual Plot Consistency:** For both seeds, the generated "Solução PINN" plots are visually very similar to the "Solução Medida". This confirms that the model consistently learns the correct shape of the solution.
*   **Discovered Viscosity Consistency:**
    *   **Seed 1:** Final Discovered `nu`: `0.037482`
    *   **Seed 2:** Final Discovered `nu`: `0.043578`

    While the discovered `nu` values are not identical, they are both significantly closer to the true value of `0.05` compared to the initial attempts. The values are in a similar range, indicating a reasonable level of consistency in parameter discovery.

### Conclusion

The multi-time-step training strategy, combined with a PDE loss weight of 5, has proven effective. The model consistently produces visually accurate solutions that match the measured data, and it is able to discover the viscosity parameter with reasonable accuracy and consistency across different random initializations.

**The primary objective, which was to ensure the output figure "pinn_results_03_scipy_test.jpg" shows the "Measured Solution" and "PINN Solution" correctly, with the graphs being similar, has been successfully met.** The discovered viscosity parameter is also much closer to the true value than initially observed.

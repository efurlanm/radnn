## Review 032

### Analysis of the Results

After setting the PDE loss weight to 20, I observed the following:

*   **Discovered Viscosity:** The final discovered viscosity is `0.058617`, which is still very close to the true value of `0.05`.
*   **Visual Plot:** The plot shows that the PINN solution is still not a good visual match for the measured solution. The shape is significantly different, indicating that the model is still prioritizing PDE satisfaction over data fitting.

This confirms that even with a PDE loss weight of 20, the model is struggling to balance the two objectives.

### Proposed Next Steps

To further encourage data fitting, I will reduce the weight of the PDE loss even further. I will try a value of `5` to see if it allows the model to better fit the data while still maintaining a reasonable `nu` discovery. I will then run the experiment and analyze the results.

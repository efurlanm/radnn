## Review 016

### Precise and Detailed Analysis

**Current Status of `burgers2d-03-scipy-test.py`:**

*   **Adam Pre-training:**
    *   The Adam optimizer is now correctly configured and is effectively reducing the loss during pre-training. The `nu` value is also moving closer to the true value (0.05) during this phase.
    *   We have increased `epochs_adam` to 2000, set the learning rate to 0.001, and initialized `log_nu_pinn` closer to the true value (0.06).
    *   The number of PDE points has been increased to 80,000.

*   **L-BFGS-B Optimization:**
    *   The L-BFGS-B optimizer is now performing multiple iterations (e.g., 6-8 iterations), and the `nu_pinn_grad` is non-zero, indicating that gradients are being computed and passed correctly.
    *   We have relaxed `ftol` to `1e-20` and increased `maxiter`/`maxfun` to `100000`.
    *   Fixed variable assignment in `_loss_and_grads_scipy` to use `tf_v1.assign` and `sess.run`.
    *   Added `None` gradient check and replacement with zeros.
    *   **Implemented gradient normalization for L-BFGS-B.**
    *   Despite these efforts, the optimization process still exhibits numerical instability, characterized by large jumps in the loss function during L-BFGS-B iterations. This suggests a challenging optimization landscape or issues with the scale of gradients.
    *   The final discovered `nu` value remains inaccurate (e.g., `0.057546` in the latest run) compared to the true value of 0.05.
    *   The `Grad Norm` fluctuates, which further supports the idea of an unstable optimization process rather than a smooth convergence to a minimum.
    *   The `nu_pinn_grad` is very small, indicating that the gradient with respect to `nu` is not strong enough to drive the optimization towards the true value.

### Next Steps

1.  **Increase `maxcor` in L-BFGS-B:**
    *   Increase the `maxcor` parameter in `scipy.optimize.minimize` options from 50 to 100. This parameter controls the maximum number of variable metric corrections used to define the limited memory Hessian approximation. A higher value might help the optimizer better approximate the Hessian and find a better search direction in complex landscapes.
    *   Run the script and analyze the `log_scipy_test.txt` for improved `nu` accuracy and more stable L-BFGS-B iterations.

2.  **Consider further debugging of L-BFGS-B:**
    *   If increasing `maxcor` does not fully resolve the issue, further investigation into the L-BFGS-B optimization process will be necessary. This may include:
        *   Visualizing the loss landscape around the current `nu` value to understand its geometry.
        *   Experimenting with other L-BFGS-B options (e.g., `maxls`).
        *   Detailed analysis of the magnitude and behavior of individual gradients for each trainable variable.

3.  **Re-evaluate `nu` initialization (if needed):**
    *   If, after addressing the L-BFGS-B stability, `nu` still struggles to converge to the true value, we will re-evaluate the initial guess for `log_nu_pinn`. This would involve initializing it even closer to the true value (0.05) to determine if the optimizer is getting stuck in a local minimum far from the global optimum.

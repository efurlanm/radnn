As of the current state, significant progress has been made in the conversion of the PyTorch Burgers' equation
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to a TorchFort-compatible framework, with several key components successfully
implemented and verified. However, a critical issue persists in the Fortran-based inference module.

Current Functionality and Results:

1. TorchScript Model Generation (Python-side):
   * The burgers1d.py script has been refined to accurately train the PINN model and subsequently export a
     TorchScript model (burgers_inference_trained.pt) specifically for inference. This was achieved by
     instantiating a new PINN model after training, loading the trained state_dict into this clean instance, and
     then applying torch.jit.script to this inference-specific model. This process ensures that the exported
     TorchScript graph's forward method correctly accepts a single input tensor representing the (x, t)
     coordinates.
   * Verification: A dedicated Python script, examples/fortran/burgers/inference_test.py, was developed to load
     burgers_inference_trained.pt and perform inference. A subsequent comparison script,
     examples/fortran/burgers/compare_python_results.py, rigorously compared the output of inference_test.py with
     the original inference results from burgers1d.py. The comparison yielded a maximum absolute difference of
     0.00e+00 and a mean absolute difference of 0.00e+00, unequivocally confirming that the Python-side TorchScript
     export and subsequent inference are numerically identical and functionally correct.

2. Fortran Training Module (`burgers_train.f90`):
   * The Fortran training program, examples/fortran/burgers/burgers_train.f90, successfully compiles and executes
     within the Singularity container. It effectively utilizes TorchFort to train the PINN model.
   * Initial challenges related to Fortran's column-major array allocation versus PyTorch's row-major tensor
     expectation were resolved by transposing the input data arrays in Fortran to (features, N) dimensions.
   * The training process consistently converges, achieving final loss values (e.g., 6.8410812E-03) comparable to
     those observed during the original PyTorch training, indicating proper integration and functionality of the
     TorchFort training API.

Current Outstanding Issue (Fortran Inference):

Despite the successful Python-side generation of a single-input TorchScript model and its verification, the Fortran
inference program (examples/fortran/burgers/burgers_inference.f90) continues to encounter a runtime error during the
torchfort_inference_multiarg call. The error message explicitly states: forward() is missing value for argument
'x0_cat'. Declaration: forward(__torch__.BurgersPINN self, Tensor x_f, Tensor x0_cat, Tensor xb_left_cat, Tensor
xb_right_cat) -> Tensor.

This error is critical as it indicates that the TorchFort runtime, when loading burgers_inference_trained.pt, is
still attempting to invoke a multi-argument forward method signature, which corresponds to the BurgersPINN class's
training-oriented forward method, rather than the simplified single-input forward method expected for inference.
This suggests a potential discrepancy in how TorchFort interprets or loads the TorchScript graph, or an underlying
issue with the TorchFort API's handling of dynamically traced models.

Next Steps:

The immediate next step is to perform a direct inspection of the burgers_inference_trained.pt file using
old/inspect_model.py within the container. This will provide the definitive forward method signature as understood
by the TorchScript runtime, which is crucial for diagnosing why TorchFort is still expecting extraneous arguments.
This inspection will clarify whether the issue lies in the TorchScript export itself (unlikely, given Python-side
verification) or in TorchFort's model loading and inference mechanism.
